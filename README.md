# SketchyBot - The CNC Etch A Sketch®
SketchyBot is a computer numerically controlled Etch-A-Sketch. It's designed to introduce it’s viewers to modern control systems, like the ones found in CNC Mills and 3D Printers. 

This robot is able to rotate the dials of the Etch-A-Sketch™ to plot out any given path. he machine utilizes two NEMA 17 pancake stepper motors, an Arduino Uno, and a GRBL 1.1 sheild.<p align="center">

The STL files are public, but the DXF files you'll need for laser cutting aren't ready for me to share. If you're impatient, you can contact me (lucianchapar@gmail.com) or derive them yourself from the SOLIDWORKS assembly.
