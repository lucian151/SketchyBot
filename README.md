# SketchyBot - The CNC Etch-a-Sketch®
SketchyBot is a computer numerically controlled Etch-A-Sketch. It's designed to introduce it’s viewers to modern control systems, like the ones found in CNC Mills and 3D Printers. 

This robot is able to rotate the dials of the Etch-A-Sketch™ to plot out any given path. he machine utilizes two NEMA 17 pancake stepper motors, an Arduino Uno, and a GRLB 1.1 sheild.

The STL files are public, but the DXF files you'll need for laser cutting aren't ready for me to share. If you're impatient, you can contact me (lucianchapar@gmail.com) or derive them yourself from the SOLIDWORKS assembly.

The build-log is hosted on my website - http://luciancapar.com/category/projects/sketchybot/
