# SketchyBot - The CNC Etch-a-Sketch®
SketchyBot is a computer numerically controlled Etch-A-Sketch. It's designed to introduce it’s viewers to modern control systems, like the ones found in CNC Mills and 3D Printers. 

This robot is able to rotate the dials of the Etch-A-Sketch™ to plot out any given path. he machine utilizes two NEMA 17 pancake stepper motors, an Arduino Uno, and a GRLB 1.1 sheild.

STL files and DXF files will be posted eventually. If you're impatient you can contact me (lucianchapar@gmail.com) or derive them yourself from the SOLIDWORKS files.

The build-log is hosted on my website - http://luciancapar.com/category/projects/sketchybot/
